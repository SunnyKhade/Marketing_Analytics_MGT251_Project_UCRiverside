# PittaRosso: AI-Driven Pricing and Promotion Strategy

## 📌 Overview
This repository presents an in-depth marketing analytics case study on **PittaRosso**, a leading Italian footwear retailer, as part of the Marketing Analytics (MGT 251) course at the University of California, Riverside.

The project explores how PittaRosso implemented an **AI-powered pricing and promotion system** developed by Evo Pricing to address high inventory levels, outdated discounting strategies, and declining profitability.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate the adoption of an AI pricing tool.
- Define the optimal objective function (Sell-through, Margin, Revenue).
- Develop a SKU-level markdown and promotion strategy.
- Estimate the financial outcomes under various assumptions.
- Recommend change management and governance solutions.

## ⚙️ Methodology
- **Objective Function**:  
  `Objective = 0.4 × Sell-Through + 0.3 × Gross Margin + 0.3 × Revenue`
- **Markdown Strategy**:
  - 20–30% markdowns for aged summer SKUs with high inventory.
  - Avoid heavy discounting on SKUs with high margin or recent sales.

  - Broad “3x2” promotions in late July to clear seasonal inventory.
- **Marketing Plan**:
  - Targeted emails/SMS to loyalty club members.
  - Budget: €15,000–€20,000.
  - A/B testing for campaign optimization.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Organizational alignment (IT, Marketing, Finance) is critical for AI success.
- Objective functions must evolve seasonally based on business priorities.
