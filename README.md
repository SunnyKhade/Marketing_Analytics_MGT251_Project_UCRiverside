# PittaRosso: AI-Driven Pricing and Promotion Strategy

## üìå Overview
This repository presents an in-depth marketing analytics case study on **PittaRosso**, a leading Italian footwear retailer, as part of the Marketing Analytics (MGT 251) course at the University of California, Riverside.

The project explores how PittaRosso implemented an **AI-powered pricing and promotion system** developed by Evo Pricing to address high inventory levels, outdated discounting strategies, and declining profitability.

## üéØ Objectives
- Evaluate the adoption of an AI pricing tool.
- Define the optimal objective function (Sell-through, Margin, Revenue).
- Develop a SKU-level markdown and promotion strategy.
- Estimate the financial outcomes under various assumptions.
- Recommend change management and governance solutions.
